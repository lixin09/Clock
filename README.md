The project has two java files named MainActivity.java and pieView.java, there is also a layout file name activity_main.xml. import the build.gradle file submitted on elms by selecting "use gradle wrapper" when importing files to android studio. If the error occurs, that would be caused by missing appcompat_v7 library, just importing the supporting library then it should work.
